### A multiscale spatial-temporal-spectral feature fusion network for predicting multiple air pollutants ###

<font face="Times new roman" size=4>
This repo is the implementation of our manuscript entitled A multiscale spatial-temporal-spectral feature fusion network for predicting multiple air pollutants. The code is based on Pytorch 1.12.1, and tested on a GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB memory.


Accurate prediction of air quality at urban monitoring stations, while accounting for the complex interactions and impacts among multiple pollutants, is crucial for enhancing urban environmental quality and public health. However, current research predominantly focuses on predicting individual pollutant indicators, without incorporating the interactions between pollutants into the modeling process, leading to limitations in prediction accuracy and capability. To address this issue, a Multiscale Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Feature Fusion Network (MSTSFF) for predicting multiple air pollutants at air quality monitoring stations is proposed. Experimental results on three urban air quality datasets showed that the proposed MSTSFF outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in prediction various pollutants. MSTSFF's structural framework and key modules for characterizing and fusing the multiscale features in temporal, spatial and spectral dimensions can also serve as the fundamental components of more general modeling structures for other multi-variant spatio-temporal dynamics.
